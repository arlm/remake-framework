Remake is an open-source framework that lets you create an editable web app for all your users with just a few custom HTML attributes.

- Simple syntax
- User accounts & database
- Inline editing & uploads
- **No backend coding!**

## 🤔 Why Remake?

> Remake turns a plain HTML website into an app that each of your users 👩📝 can login to and modify their own version of 👩📝👵📝👨📝 — **with only HTML!**

![Diagram of how Remake works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/364330/98125645-b5d2b980-1e82-11eb-909f-527bf0ff224e.png)

Remake does what most frameworks do in 100 lines of code in 1 line of HTML.

```html
<h1 object key:text="@innerText" edit:text>{{text}}</h1>
```

This 👆 is a full app that users can login to. Each user can edit & share their own copy of this headline! 📰 📰 📰

## 👩‍🎨 Ever design something and want people to use it *right away*?

### Remake lets you do that.

<details>
  <summary><b>Build full-stack web apps with front-end code.</b></summary>
  
  Remake takes care of the rest: user accounts, persistent data, instant deployments, and routing. Each user gets their own account and data.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Produce real apps, not just prototypes.</b></summary>
  
  Remake feels like prototyping because it was designed to. The goal was to make web development feel like using a single template and a single JSON file.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>You have 100% control of the design.</b></summary>
  
  Remake is open source. You own the code. There's no platform lock-in and you have 100% control over your app's design.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Secure, scalable, and fast.</b></summary>
  
  Highly secure authentication. And server-rendered, so your pages load quickly even on low-power devices and slow connections.
</details>


## 👩‍🏫 Get started

**1. Install [Node.js (12.16+)](https://nodejs.org/)**

**2. Create a project using the Remake CLI**

```
npx remake create my-app
```

**3. Run the project**

```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

You now have an app running at `http://localhost:3000`. Your app's code is in the `/app` directory and your database is in the `/app/data` directory.

## 🚀 Remake’s Mission

A few companies own the platforms the rest of us publish on — but owning our own platform is usually out of reach. Remake lets you build your own platform with very little effort, using just HTML & CSS.
